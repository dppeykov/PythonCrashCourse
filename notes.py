# HOW PYTHON WORKS: Python source code -->> compile step -->> bytecode -->> interpreted by the python virtual machine (virtual CPU) 
# Note: The VM is written in C and when running a python program it gets compiled to machine code, so then it can interpreter and run the bytecode

# VARIABLES
# Naming - can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores; can't start with a number; no spacing - use _; short & descriptive; don't use keywords 
# Just a label to a box (value) in the memory - the variable is referencing the value
